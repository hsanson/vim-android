1. Intro                                                      *vim-android-intro*

vim-android is a plugin that facilitates the development of Android
applications withing vim. When editing a java or xml file this plugin tries
to find an AndroidManifest.xml file in the current directory and if found it
cofigures a set of variables and commands that allows easier development for
Android applications.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SUPPORTED FEATURES                                         *vim-android-features*

The following features are supported by vim-android:

  - Auto-detection of Android projects when opening a Java or XML file. This
    relies on the AndroidManifest.xml file being located on the current
    working directory.
  - Updates the CLASSPATH environment variable to include paths for your
    current project, external libs, external lib-projects and the current
    target Android SDK jars. This allows auto-completion of Java code using
    other plugins such as javacomplete.
  - Adds useful commands to compile and install your application APK into
    your emulator/devices.
  - Adds useful commands to generate tags for the current project source and
    the Android SDK sources.

==============================================================================
2. Requirements                                        *vim-android-requirements*

The following requirements have to be met in order to be able to use vim-android:

  - Vim 7.3 or higher. This plugin may also work with previous versions but I
    have only tested Vim 7.3.
  - Android SDK installed and with the platform-tools directory set in your
    PATH environment variable.

==============================================================================
3. Installation                                        *vim-android-installation*

It is recommended that you use a package manager like Pathogen or Vundle to
install this plugin. In the case of Vundle all you have to do is add this
line to your vimrc:
>
       Bundle 'hsanson/vim-android'
<
and then inside vim run the |:BundleInstall| command.

==============================================================================
4. Usage                                                      *vim-android-usage*

There are two requirements for this plugin to work correctly: First you must set
the g:android_sdk_path variable in you vimrc file so the plugin can find
the tools it needs, second this plugin assumes that your current working
directory contains the AndroidManifest.xml of your android project.

If these two requirements are satisfied then everytime you open a Java or XML
file this plugin will enable several commands vim-android-commands that greatly
facilitate tasks such as building and installing your APK into emulators and/or
devices.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
COMMANDS                                                   *vim-android-commands*

:AndroidDebug                                                   *:AndroidDebug*
    Builds the application APK in debug mode.

:AndroidRelease                                               *:AndroidRelease*
    Builds the application APK in release mode.

:AndroidDebugInstall                                       *:AndroidDebugInstall*
    Compiles and installs the application in debug mode. In the case that you
    have several emulators running and/or several devices connected then this
    command will present you a list of emulators/devices so you can choose to
    which one the APK should be installed to.

:AndroidReleaseInstall                                 *:AndroidReleaseInstall*
    This is the same as the :AndroidDebugInstall command but builds the APK
    in release mode instead of debug mode.

:AndroidUpdateAndroidTags                           *:AndroidUpdateAndroidTags*
    This is a simple helper command that generates a tags file from the
    android sdk sources. This tags files is automatically added to the local
    *tags* variable. This can be used for some tag based auto-completion plugins
    to enable auto-completion of android classes and methods.

    Generating the tags file for the Android SDK requires that you have the
    ctags command utility installed and available in your PATH. Also consider
    that this can take a long time to finish so use it only when you update your
    SDK.

:AndroidUpdateProjectTags
    This is similar to the :AndroidUpdateAndroidTags command but it generates
    the tags file for the current Android source code. This allows other tags
    based auto-completion plugins to auto-complete classes and methods of your
    own sources.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
KEY MAPPINGS                                                  *vim-android-keys*
By default the vim-android plugin has not mappings and all functionality is
accessed using the commmands vim-android-commands but this does not impede
you from creating your own mappings.

For example you can map a function key (e.g. F5) so it invokes the
:AndroidDebugInstall command:

>
nmap <F5> <ESC>:AndroidDebugInstall<CR>
<

this way anytime you press the <F5> key it will build and install your
Android application.

==============================================================================
5. Configuration                                     *vim-android-configuration*

                                                        *g:android_sdk_path*
g:android_sdk_path~
Default: /opt/android-sdk

This option must specify the location of your Android SDK installation.

Example:
>
        let g:android_sdk_path = '/opt/adroid-sdk'
<

                                                            *g:android_adb_tool*
g:android_adb_tool~
Default: empty

This plugin relies heavily on the Android ADB tool to query devices/emulators
and to install the APK files. By default this tool is found inside the
Android SDK so you do not need to set this variable but if for some reason in
you installation the ADB tool is located in a different path you can
explicitly tell the plugin where to find it using this variable.

Example:
>
        let g:android_adb_tool=/path/to/tool/adb
<

                                                            *g:android_sdk_tags*
g:android_sdk_tags~
Default: ~/.vim/tags/android

By default the :AndroidUpdateAndroidTags commands generates the tags file in
~/.vim/tags/android. This file is automatically added to the *:tags*
variable. If you prefer the tags to be generated in a different place you may
change the default using this global variable.

Example:
>
        let g:android_sdk_tags=/path/to/tags/android.tags
<

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ANDROID OMNI-COMPLETION                             *vim-android-omnicomplete*

This plugin by itself does not provide omni-completion of Android classes
and/or methods. Instead it auto-configures the CLASSPATH environment variable
so it includes all the JAR files related to your project so other plugins
like the javacomplete (https://github.com/vim-scripts/javacomplete) can do
omni-completion.

The JAR files added to your CLASSPATH environment includes the Android SDK
jar for the target API defined in the AndroidManifest.xml, any JAR files in
the libs directory and any JAR files of external lib-projects defined in the
project.properties file. With this CLASSPATH and the javacomplete plugin I am
able to omni-complete all classes and methods for my project.

==============================================================================
9. Todo                                                          *vim-android-todo*

  - Add secure prompt to AndroidReleaseInstall that requires users to input
    the keystore and sign key passwords. Not sure how to make Vim not display
    the input text on screen.
  - Better Android XML omni-completion.
  - Maybe add one of the LogCat plugins arround to show the log directly
    inside Vim. This is low priority for me as the Android monitor is good for
    my purposes.

==============================================================================
10. Credits                                                *vim-android-credits*

vim-android was written from scratch but I learned and used as reference
several other plugins:

 - https://github.com/bpowell/vim-android
 - https://github.com/mgarriott/vim-android
 - https://github.com/anddam/android-javacomplete
